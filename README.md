This project is a small demonstration showing a redneck approach on self-updating software.

The idea is based around using only widespread software on a Unix/Linux system.

Based on simple Bash scripts, the structure shuld be as easy to understand as possible. The stuff that needs to be done when an update is installed, can simply be written in the before-update.sh and after-update.sh scripts.
